# DingDong - Applications Group Project
## By: The Bellhops (Group 2)



## Description

Ding Dong is an app that collects information from users about their travel plans and it sends their information
to the chosen hotel chain so that those hotel chains can then send their offers to the customer directly. This is great for
customers who don't want to spend countless hours searching for hotels and it is also a great lead generator for hotels.

### How to run the application

 - Main Scene - Two buttons to select from: book now or view/edit booking. Book now button takes you to hotel selection screen. View/edit button takes you to the view/edit screen.
 - Hotel Booking Scene - All functionalities of the hotel booking scene are currently working. User has 6 options to choose from and can add all 6 hotels. They can also click on the clear button if they would like to start over. Any option they add using the add button will be added to an array that can later be accessed when the booking is made. The user can also click on the page title which will display a list of all the hotels they have already picked.
 - Booking scene - Page where user's information will be input. The input is then stored in a file for later access in case the user needs to view/edit their booking. After being stored the information will be sent to the selected hotels so they may reach out to the user.
 - Editing scene - The user searches for their booking using their email. If a booking associated with the email entered is found, the users information is displayed. The user can then choose what information they need to edit. After they are done editing, the information is updated and stored in the file. The updated information will be sent to the users selected hotels.
