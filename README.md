# DingDong - Applications Group Project

## Description

Ding Dong is an app that collects information from users about their travel plans and it sends their information
to the chosen hotel chain so that those hotel chains can then send their offers to the customer directly. This is great for
customers who don't want to spend countless hours searching for hotels and it is also a great lead generator for hotels.
